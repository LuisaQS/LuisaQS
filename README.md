<h1>Hi! I'm Luisa, a Front-end Developer ✨✨✨</h1>

💖 I love turning code into beautiful things, so I'm always up for a new css challenge or intricate logics to create an awesome user experience. 

🗂️ I'm a really organized person with a wall full of post-its and planners, which translates to my coding style as well, meaning I value testing, clean code and always refactor what is needed when I have the time.

📖 I'm also a gamer and an avid reader, so I not only host a book club with my friends, but with the support of my colleagues, I also help organize and host a Tech Book Club in the company I work for.
  
📚 I'm currently improving my skills with react, so I can write code that is better and cleaner!
